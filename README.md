# HomeDB

A very simple App to track, what you have at home and what needs to be purchased.

Please dont expect too much from this app, since this is just a practice project at the moment

# Installation

The installation is very simple. Just execute the following commands to install the required tools

```sh
go install github.com/go-task/task/v3/cmd/task@latest
go install github.com/air-verse/air@latest
go install github.com/a-h/templ/cmd/templ@latest
go install github.com/sqlc-dev/sqlc/cmd/sqlc@latest
go install github.com/pressly/goose/v3/cmd/goose@latest
```

Then just run either the default task for a dev-server or use build to compile the project into a single binary
